# The_VISION
This Internet of Things (IoT) project is built and developed to help the visually impaired. This project consists of 3 ultrasonic sensors, Arduino Uno, mini vibrators, and a buzzer. This device helps the person navigate and notify the user about the obstacles surrounding him, by giving them a sense of vibration with the help of mini vibrators if an obstacle comes to the userâ€™s side and makes a buzzing sound when an obstacle is in front of the user to avoid any casualties and help them live a better-advanced life and fill them with confidence.
